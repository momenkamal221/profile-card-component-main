## My process
- I noticed from the design folder that the background is flexible, I found this in MDN
``(container width - image width) * (position x%) = (x offset value)``
from this point I understood how the percentages of background-position work and then i got some sort of control over X offset value
## Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
## What I learned
- dealing with backgrounds.
- apply using calc min and max functions.
