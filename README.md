## My process
- I noticed from the design folder that the background is flexible, I found this in MDN<br>
``(container width - image width) * (position x%) = (x offset value)``<br>
from this point I understood how the percentages of background-position work and then i got some sort of control over X offset value
## Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
## What I learned
- dealing with backgrounds.
- apply using calc min and max functions.

## update Jan 28 2022 
- I really appreciate your feedback, that was so helpful and I think my code is better now
- I used the body as a flexbox to center the card
- I had an issue with the behavior of the background when you change the height of the viewport and it fixed now
- the card is more responsive now
- I changed the font so it looks like the original design now
